<h2>Game rules</h2>

    <li>Predictions for the next Grand Prix weekend can be made any time after previous Grand Prix finished.</li>
    <li>When calculating players' points for guessed places in the Qualifying, we take into account only the best lap of
        each driver, and do not consider anything that might happen after this lap (penalties, disqualifications and so 
        on).</li>
    <li>When calculating players' points for guessed places in the Race, we take into account only the drivers' final
        places (e.g. after all referee checks has been performed and applied to the race results).</li>
    <li>So far there is no option to predict Sprint results (can be added later).</li>
</ol>
